        This is a demo application for Feedback, a lightweight library which provides
        a ready-to-use Material-ized UI for collecting user feedbacks from within an existing app.
        \n
        Unlike other similar libraries, Feedback allows you to capture a screenshot of the current activity,
        which you may manipulate in your callbacks.
        \n\n
        Use the menu to provide feedback.
        \n\n
